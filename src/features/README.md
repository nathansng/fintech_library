# Data Pre-Processing

Pre-process and reformat data to convert to a machine-learning ready state. This module includes the following pre-processing functions: 

1. Linear approximation: Extracts trend slops and durations from sequential time series data

2. Scaler: Normalizes data for more efficient machine learning training

3. Create training, validation, and test sets from sequential time series data or trend data
