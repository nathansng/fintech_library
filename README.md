# FinDL - Financial Deep Learning Library

## DSC 180A Quarter 1 Project 

The goal of this project is to create a deep learning and machine learning library that allows users to easily create and deploy machine learning models for finance related tasks. 
This repo focuses on implementing time series forecasting model. The following models have been implemented or is planned to be included in the library. 

- CNN
- LSTM
- TreNet

Our data is download from Kaggle.com. The dataset that we used for our experiment is the Stock Exchange Data created by Cody in 2018. The dataset is available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mattiuzc/stock-exchange-data.
